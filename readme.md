# 🧩 Physics Simulations

Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of **2D/3D physics simulation projects** designed to demonstrate my skills in:

- **Python & Pygame** for real-time simulations
- Translating real-world physics problems into **clean, modular code**
- Designing **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** datasets with prompt/solution pairs
- Performing **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** style output comparisons
- Creating high-quality proprietary data for foundational LLM companies
